    The yaml object at the end of the body of draft PR pull requests now contains
    information about previous failed batches. The new data is in a new key called
    "previous_failed_batches" which is a list of dict objects containing the number
    of the draft pr (under the "draft_pr_number" key) and the list of pull requests it checked
    (under the "checked_pull_requests" key).
    Example:
      previous_failed_batches:
        - checked_pull_requests:
          - 123
          - 124
          - 126
          draft_pr_number: 130
