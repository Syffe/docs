    Queue action has a new option `batch_max_failure_resolution_attempts`
    corresponding to the number of attempts to resolve a batch failure before
    unqueueing pull requests. By default, Mergify will attempt to resolve a
    batch failure by splitting it. You can choose to stop this process after
    several splits.
