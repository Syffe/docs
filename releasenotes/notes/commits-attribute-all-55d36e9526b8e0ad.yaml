    In the conditions, it is now possible to use the list of an attribute of all the commits.
    This can be done with the condition formatted like this: ``commits[*].<attribute>``,
    with ``<attribute>`` being one of the available attribute of a commit.
    For example, ``commits[*].commit_message`` will return the list of the commit message
    of all the commits.
    You can refer to the ``conditions/#attributes`` page on the documentation for more information.
