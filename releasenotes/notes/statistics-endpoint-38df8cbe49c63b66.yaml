        Returns the average time to merge on this queue.
      * ``/repos/{owner}/{repository}/queues/{name}/stats/checks_duration``:
        Returns the average duration of the checks of the merge queue PRs.
      * ``/repos/{owner}/{repository}/queues/{name}/stats/failure_by_reason``:
        Returns a mapping of the failure reasons of a merge queue associated with the number
        of times they happened.
