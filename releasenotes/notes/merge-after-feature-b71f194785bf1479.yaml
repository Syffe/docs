    It is now possible to set a minimum merge date on a pull request
    with the ``Merge-After`` header, to place in the body of the desired
    pull request.
    Here are the possible formats:
      - ``Year-Month-Day``, eg: "Merge-After: 2023-04-18"
      - ``Year-Month-Day[Timezone]``, eg: "Merge-After: 2023-04-18[Australia/Sydney]"
      - ``Year-Month-Day Hours:Minutes``, eg: "Merge-After: 2023-04-18 18:20"
      - ``Year-Month-Day Hours:Minutes[Timezone]``, eg: "Merge-After: 2023-04-18 18:20[Australia/Sydney]"

    If used with the ``merge`` action, the pull request will be merged after the
    specified date and time has passed.
    If used with the ``queue`` action, the pull request will be queued after the
    specified date and time has passed.

    For the list of available time zones, see `IANA format <https://www.iana.org/time-zones>`_.
