    It is now possible to use some commits details in the conditions.
    Each commit can be accessed via its index and needs to be followed by the
    attribute you want to access, eg: ``commits[0].commit_message`` for the message
    of the first commit, ``commits[-1].date_committer`` for the last commit's date.
    The available attributes are:
      - author
      - commit_message
      - commit_verification_verified
      - committer
      - date_author
      - date_committer
      - email_author
      - email_committer
    The operations available on each attribute depends on its type, you can refer
    to the ``conditions/#attributes`` page on the documentation for more information.
