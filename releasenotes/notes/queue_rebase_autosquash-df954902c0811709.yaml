    When doing inplace checks with `update_method: rebase` in the queue, it is
    now possible to also specify if you want to autosquash commits or not with
    the queue action options : ``autosquash``. It is enabled by default, and can be disabled
    by specifying `autosquash: False` in the queue rules or queue action options.
