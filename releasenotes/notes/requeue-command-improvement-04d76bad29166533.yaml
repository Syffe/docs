    The ``requeue`` command has been improved, when used it will now automatically
    queue the pull request again, only if you do not have any ``queue`` action in
    your ``pull_request_rules``. This allow to clean the failed queued state of the
    pull request and queue it again with only 1 comment.
    To go with this improved behavior, the ``requeue`` command also has a new, optional,
    ``queue-name`` parameter. It allows to specify the queue name in which you want to
    requeue the pull request, eg: ``@Mergifyio requeue default``
