      \ This pull request got squashed on behalf of a\\nrandom user of the organization.
      This behavior will change on the 1st February\\n2022, Mergify will pick the
      author of the pull request instead.\\n\\nTo get the future behavior now, you
      can configure `bot_account` options (e.g.:\\n`bot_account: { author }` or `update_bot_account:
      { author }`.\\n\\nOr you can create a dedicated github account for squash and
      rebase operations,\\nand use it in different `bot_account` options.\\n\",\"reactions\":{\"url\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/mergifyio-testing/functional-testing-repo-sileht/issues/comments/1355347391/reactions\",\"total_count\":0,\"+1\":0,\"-1\":0,\"laugh\":0,\"hooray\":0,\"confused\":0,\"heart\":0,\"rocket\":0,\"eyes\":0},\"performed_via_github_app\":null}"
