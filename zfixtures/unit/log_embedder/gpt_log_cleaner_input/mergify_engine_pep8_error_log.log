2023-04-25T07:49:15.4318586Z Note: switching to 'refs/remotes/pull/5770/merge'.
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4319255Z 
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4320449Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4320937Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4321422Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4321612Z 
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4321821Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4322484Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4322730Z 
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4322940Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4323133Z 
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4323274Z Or undo this operation with:
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4323408Z 
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4323527Z   git switch -
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4323693Z 
2023-04-25T07:49:15.4323922Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
